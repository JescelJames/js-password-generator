# My Third Challenge: Create a Random Password Generator

## Description

This is my first JavaScript challenge: To provide the user with random password. 

- My motivation:  To build a password generator that requires input from user such as amount of characters (must be from 8 - 128 characters) using lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and symbols. 
- Why I took this challege: This is my first JavaScript challenge that required functions, ifs, while loop, prompt, confirm, getElementById, addEventListener, parseInit, math.floor, and math.random.
- What the challenge solved:  The user can create a random password based on having the ability to select the length and type(letters, numbers, symbols) of characters.


- What I learned:  

1. That getElementById links to an id in HTML.
2. That it's easier to code and cleaner if I divide the codes to sections: DEPENDENCIES, DATA, FUNCTIONS, USER INTERACTIONS, AND INITIALIZATION. 
3. That functions is difficult to understand, but once I grasp the concept, the code seem to flow better.
4. That the foor..loop can make me pull my hair out if my expression #2 is not called properly.  The console does not provide any error for this...
5. That DOM is another beast of itself I need to do a lot more reading and experience.  
6. That return in function provides value.
7. That math.floor and math.random seem to go together when creating a random password generator based on my research.
8. That eventListener can be used for clicks, double clicks
